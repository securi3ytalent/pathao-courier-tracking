# Patho Courier Tracking React js, wordpress, HTML setup

Pathao Courier allows users to seamlessly track their orders through a Consignment ID. This feature involves sharing a unique Consignment ID and tracking link via SMS when the courier pickup is processed by the merchant. The user can use this Consignment ID to track the status of their order on both the Pathao Courier app and website/shop Website.

## FAQ

#### Does my merchant account need to be linked for order tracking?

No, your merchant account does not need to be linked specifically for order tracking. Once an order is picked up by Pathao Courier, a unique Consignment ID is generated and shared with the customer via SMS. The customer can then use this ID to track their order independently on the Pathao Courier app or website/shop Website.

#### Do I need a developer API for order tracking?

No, you do not need a developer API to enable order tracking. The tracking feature is integrated into the Pathao Courier system, and the Consignment ID along with the tracking link will be automatically sent to the user via SMS. Users can track their orders directly on the app or website/shop Website without requiring any additional API integration.
